# 04 - Human in the Loop

## Where HITL Helps

- approvals before external side effects
- policy review
- high-cost model/tool actions

## Pattern

1. graph reaches review node
2. workflow pauses
3. human decision resumes workflow

## Recommended Practice

Capture who approved, when, and why in state metadata.
